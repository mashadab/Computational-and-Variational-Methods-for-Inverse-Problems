## 2-line Summary
This repo has all the codes which became a part of the assignments for inverse modeling course

### Dependences

The codes requires the following packages to function:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.5+
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) >= 1.16
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) >=1.5
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) >=3.3.4
- [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/download/)
- [hiPPylib](https://hippylib.github.io/#latest-release) version 3.3.0


### Quick Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the required libraries, run the python files given in the separate folders. Codes can be run either directly or on an IDE such as Anaconda Spyder. 


## Acknowledgement
I would like to acknowledge Professor Omar Ghattas for teaching the course on 'Computational and Variational Methods for Inverse Problems' in 2021. His open-source review paper with Professor Karen Willcox has most of the theory circumscribing these codes which can be found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C072A4B417F8C3873ED75C1D63BBB31D/S0962492921000064a.pdf/learning-physics-based-models-from-data-perspectives-from-inverse-problems-and-model-reduction.pdf).
